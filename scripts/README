For convenience any of the scripts can be run using a bash script.
    For example:
        ./RunFitSingle.sh inputFile.root - will run the Fit.C script on a single file.
        ./RunFit.sh /path/to/files - will look through every file in a directory and run the Fit.C script on the root files it finds. 


Fit.C

This script reads in the waveforms, finds a minimum peak and then integrates around that peak. The results are plotted on a histogram and then a fit is run to characterise the  PMT. 

The parameters of the fit can be found in: 

The result of the fit is written to a text file `pmt.txt`:
